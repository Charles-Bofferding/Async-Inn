# ERD Explanation

The Hotel Location table has all of the information that will be stored for individual locations in the Async Hotel chain
It does not contain information about the rooms themselves but the information about the location of that particular franchise

The Room table contains all of the information that pertains to an individual room. Things of different data types are stored here
while in the previous table it was mostly string type things.

The Available rooms table is a link between the different hotels and the rooms available at each of them.
